Doom 2D: Forever utils for OS X
===============================

This is small collection of utilities for building Doom 2D: Forever for OS X (darwin)

- **builder.sh** - script for semi-automatic building Doom 2D on OS X natively
- **macportsutil.sh** - script for automatic downloading and unpacking libraries from MacPorts (useful for cross-compilation)
- **gitcheck.sh** - simple script for pulling updates from remote repository and performing some actions if there are new commits (useful for automating compile process)
- **obsolete** - directory for some other scripts, that are not necessary now for my purposes
