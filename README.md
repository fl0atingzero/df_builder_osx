Doom 2D: Forever utils for OS X
===============================

This is small collection of utilities for building Doom 2D: Forever for OS X (darwin)

- **builder.sh** - script for semi-automatic building Doom 2D on OS X natively
- **macportsutil.sh** - script that automatically downloads and unpacks libraries from MacPorts (useful for cross-compilation)
- **gitcheck.sh** - simple script for obtaining new commits from remote repository and performing some actions if there are new commits (useful for automatic compilation process)
- **obsolete** - directory for some other scripts, that are not necessary for my purposes now
